<p>Hi, I'm Jordan Legendre! I am a student at Middletown High School.</p>
<p>At Middletown High School, I part of the crew team, the band, the yearbook club, and my Relay for Life team. I also have various educational and work experience. </p>
<p>Below is a brief summary of these activities</p>

<p>I play clarinet in the Middletown High School Marching and Concert Bands. I have been a section leader since my sophomore year. We compete locally and perform during halftime at football games in the fall. During the winter and spring we prepare for seasonal concerts and parades. </p>

<h3>Yearbook</h3>
<p>I joined the yearbook club my junior year, and immediately took on the responsibility of being a junior editor. I work with the other editors and yearbook club members to create our high school's yearbook, The Lair. </p>

<h3>Relay for Life</h3>
<p>I am captain of a Relay for Life team in Middletown. My team is called "Team Past Our Bedtime". We raise money throughout the year for the American Cancer Society through donations and fundrasiers that we organize. Last year, our team rasied over $3,000.</p>

<h3>Learn to Commit: A Coding Bootcamp for Women and Girl (January 30, 2016)</h3>
<p>I attended a workshop at Wesleyan University for women and girls where I created this website! I learned a lot about how computers work and how to code. </p>
