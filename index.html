<p>Hi, I'm Jordan Legendre! I am a student at Middletown High School.</p>
<p>At Middletown High School, I am part of the crew team, the band, the yearbook club, and my Relay for Life team. I also have various educational and work experience. </p>
<p>Below is a brief summary of these activities</p>
<h2>Clubs and Activities</h2>
<h3>Crew</h3>
<p>The Middletown High School crew team rows on the Connecticut river in the fall and spring seasons. On the team, I have been a rower as well as a coxswain. During the summers, I work for <a href="http://www.centralctrowing.com/">Central Connecticut Rowing</a> where I cox </p>

<h3>Band</h3>
<p>I play clarinet in the Middletown High School Marching and Concert Bands. I have been a section leader since my sophomore year. We compete locally and perform during halftime at football games in the fall. During the winter and spring we prepare for seasonal concerts and parades. </p>

<h3>Yearbook</h3>
<p>I joined the yearbook club my junior year, and immediately took on the responsibility of being a junior editor. I work with the other editors and yearbook club members to create our high school's yearbook, The Lair. </p>

<h3>Relay for Life</h3>
<p>I am captain of a Relay for Life team in Middletown. My team is called "Team Past Our Bedtime". We raise money throughout the year for the American Cancer Society through donations and fundrasiers that we organize. Last year, our team rasied over $3,000.</p>

<h2>Educational Experiences</h2>
<h3>Learn to Commit: A Coding Bootcamp for Women and Girl (January 30, 2016)</h3>
<p>I attended a workshop at Wesleyan University for women and girls where I created this website! I learned a lot about how computers work and how to code. </p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>Middletown Children's Theatre</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2015, I worked as a camp counselor at the Middletown Children's Theatre with kids between the ages of 6 and 12. In the mornings, kids would go to different workshops to prepare for a camp showcase for their families. I assisted the music teachers in workshops in vocal harmony as well as Broadway performance. The vocal harmony group performed an a capella medley including "I Will be Gentle with Myself" by Libana, "Lollipop" by the Chordettes, and "We Belong" by Pat Bentley.
 In the Broadway style workshop, the campers performed a song and dance to "You Can't Stop the Beat" from the musical Hairspray. After a snack break and some free time, I helped the campers rehearse for their production of Aladdin Jr. This included practicing lines, learning songs and choreography, and running through scenes. 
My theatre experience included only a back-up role in Seussical Jr. in third grade, so working at this camp was a really great experience. I learned so much from the campers and other counselors about what goes into producing a musical. </p>  

<h3>Central Connecticut Rowing</h3>
<p> Three evenings a week in the summers, I worked at the city of Middletown's Parks and Rec's summer crew program. This included the adult team, Central Connecticut Rowing, as well as teens from the local high school teams, and other new rowers from the community. 
As a coxswain for the program, I gave commands, steered the 50' rowing shells, and helped critique the rowers. Working with the new rowers, called novice, was always exciting because of all the responsibility that comes with being the leader of a group who is still learning the basics of the sport. 
I liked explaining different aspects of the sport and answering questions as the practices progressed. My favorite part of the evening crew program was watching the sunset over the river just as practice was ending.

<h3>Bob's Store's</h3>
<p>Over the winter season, I worked as a sales associate at a retail clothing and shoe store. During most shifts, I would either be at the register or on the floor. At the register, I would checkout the customers, apply their coupons and rewards, and handle their payment of credit, debit, cash or check. When I was on the floor, I would organize, fold and clean the sections I was assigned to. I would also be responsible for putting returned items back onto the floor, and answering phone calls from other stores or customers looking for certain items to put on hold or have shipped. I really enjoyed helping customers at the register figure out the best way to apply their coupons and rewards to get the best deal (especially on Black Friday)!</p>
